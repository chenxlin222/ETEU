# ETEU-tracker

Matlab implementation of our ETEU tracker.

The results, precision and success plots for six aerial tracking benchmarks have been released. And the code is coming soon.

## Demonstration running instructions

This code is compatible with six aerial tracking benchmarks, i.e., UAV123, UAV123@10fps, UAVDT, DTB70, VisDrone2018-SOT-test, and UAVTrack112. It is easy to run this tracker as long as you have MATLAB. Just download the package and do the following steps:
